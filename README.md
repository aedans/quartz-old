# Quartz

Quartz is a high level functional programming language designed
for asynchronous computation using the gpu. It provides powerful
optimizations such as pure function caching and deferred
declarations to take full advantage of the gpu without needing
to worry about low-level thread management. Quartz compiles to 
CUDA-C, allowing for easy use with other C/C++/CUDA 
applications, and provides simple yet effective ways to use
existing C/C++/CUDA programs and libraries.
